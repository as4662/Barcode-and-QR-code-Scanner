# Barcode-and-QR-Code-Scanner

Quick Response (QR) codes and Barcodes have become an important component
to enable various technical solutions and are being used by millions of people
around the world every day. With the tremendous increase in usage of QR codes
and the growing number of applications mostly including sensitive tasks such as
payment and ticketing, it becomes vital to understand the current state of the
technology, its implementation, limitations, and scope for future work. Our
project is aimed at fulfilling this purpose and provides an analysis of the latest
advancements in QR code detection and pre-processing technologies and also
reveals the multi-step process of QR code recognition. This is a great machine
learning project using digital image processing techniques. QR codes are
frequently used to track information about products in a supply chain, often used
in marketing and advertising campaigns. Barcodes are applied to products as a
means of quick identification. They are used in retail stores as part of the purchase
process, in warehouses to track inventory, and on invoices to assist in accounting.
